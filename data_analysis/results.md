The Wikidata JSON dump ([https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/]())
is used to analyze the characteristics of root classes in Wikidata.
(See definitions.md, on how root class is defined in this context.)

## Goals:
* (Find number of all classes.)
* Find all classes without parents (root classes).
* Find topics of the root classes.
* How many children?
* How many properties?
* What types of properties?
* Similarities between root classes.
* How many outgoing connections to other items in Wikidata?
