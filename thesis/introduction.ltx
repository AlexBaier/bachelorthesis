\textbf{Knowledge bases (KB)} like DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata store information about every significant real-world entity and the relations between those entities.
Using different approaches like human collaboration in Wikidata or information from Wikipedia data boxes in YAGO, these KBs are populated \cite{Galarraga2016}.
The issue of incompleteness arises in this context, as it is not realistic to assume that every bit of knowledge can or should be captured in the KBs.
\textbf{Ontologies} are necessary for modeling, sharing, and exchanging knowledge \cite{Hazman2011}, and are therefore integral in the functioning of a KB \cite{Wong2012}.
They provide data schemas, concept vocabularies and rules \cite{Maedche2001} to which a KB has to adhere.
Therefore, it should be a priority to ensure the completeness of the ontology in a KB.
Types of ontologies range from lightweight ontologies like glossaries and taxonomies (concept hierarchies) to heavyweight ontologies like data models and description logics
\cite{Wong2012}.

The thesis' goal is the development and evaluation of approaches to increase the completeness of ontological taxonomies.
Specifically, the problem of classifying \textbf{orphan classes} is solved.
Orphan classes are classes in a taxonomy, which have no superclasses (parents) and are not the root of the taxonomy.
An example, for such a classification problem is given in Figure~\ref{fig:problem example}.
An extract of the Wikidata taxonomy is shown. 
The class \textit{reversal film} is an orphan class in the taxonomy, since it is has no superclass.
A possible solution is represented by the dotted arrow, which places \textit{photographic film} as superclass of \textit{reversal film}.
It has to be noted that additionally all superclasses of \textit{photographic film} are also valid solutions to the problem for the orphan class \textit{reversal film},
since the subclass-of relationship is transitive.
A solution to the problem should find the most specific superclass for a given orphan class \cite{Doan2002}.
An algorithm is developed with the task of classifying such orphan classes into a given taxonomy.
The algorithm will use neural word embeddings, as developed by \fullcite{Mikolov2013}. This is motivated by the effectiveness of neural networks in other context-sensitive tasks
like language processing \cite{Mikolov2013} \cite{Kalchbrenner2014} \cite{Arisoy2012}, image generation \cite{Gregor2015} etc.
Neural word embeddings are especially interesting, since they have been used to great effect in the construction of taxonomies \cite{Fu2014},
graph representation \cite{Cao2016} and semantic similarity tasks \cite{Mikolov2013a} \cite{Levy2014}.
Different approaches in using neural word embeddings for classification of orphan classes will be considered and evaluated in this work.

In this work, the taxonomy of Wikidata is considered as case example, as it provides a high number of entities ($24,507,102$ in \dumpdate{} \cite{WikidataDump}),
and a big taxonomy consisting of $1,299,501$ classes \cite{WikidataDump}.
At this time, Wikidata's taxonomy is mostly maintained by human editors.
The solution developed by the thesis should be able to support the editors in improving the completeness of the taxonomy by reducing the number of orphan classes
and refining the existing taxonomic relations between classes.

The thesis is structured as follows.
In Chapter~\ref{section:foundations} the problem will be formally defined (\ref{section:wikidata}, \ref{section:taxonomy}, \ref{section:similarity}, \ref{section:problem statement})
and related work in the fields of neural networks (\ref{section:neural networks}) and ontology learning (\ref{section:ontology learning}) discussed for the use in this work.
Section~\ref{section:neural networks} introduces the notion of neural networks and discusses work dealing with neural word and graph embeddings.
Section~\ref{section:ontology learning} compares the problem, solved by the thesis, to related work in the field of ontology learning. 
Subsequently, the problem is classified, solutions to similar problems analyzed and the novelty of the work justified.
Chapter~\ref{section:taxonomy analysis} describes the Wikidata data set used as case example for the implementation and evaluation of the proposed hybrid algorithm. 
Chapter~\ref{section:algorithm} describes the components of the developed baseline algorithm and variations, which potentially improve the effectiveness of the method.
Chapter~\ref{section:evaluation} describes the evaluation methodology and presents the results.
The baseline algorithm and proposed improvements are evaluated.

Formatting of text obeys the following rules. 
Italic text indicates Wikidata entities like \entity{} or \textit{instance of (P31)}.
Bold text indicates the first occurrence of a relevant concept, such as \textbf{orphan class}.
Such concepts are described in the following sentences and, if necessary, formally defined.
Figures with long descriptions are framed to clearly separate continuous text and description of the figure.
In-line quotes are indicated by quotation marks. The corresponding citation is placed after the quote.
Multi-line quotes are indented. The quote is introduced by a short sentence, which contains the citation.
