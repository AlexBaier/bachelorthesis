Knowledge bases (KB) like DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata try to store information about every significant entity in the real word and the relations between those entities.
Using different approaches like human collaboration in Wikidata or information from Wikipedia databoxes in YAGO, these knowledge bases are populated \cite{Galagarra2016}.
The issue of incompleteness arises in this context, as it is not realistic to assume that every bit of knowledge can and should be captured in the KBs.
Ontologies are necessary for modeling, sharing, and exchanging knowledge \cite{Hazman2011}, and are therefore integral in the functioning of a knowledge base \cite{Wong2012}.
They provide data schemas, concept vocabularies and rules \cite{Maedche2001} to which a KB has to adhere.
Therefore, it should be a priority to ensure the completeness of the ontology in a KB.
Types of ontologies range from lightweight ontologies like glossaries and taxonomies (concept hierarchies) to heavyweight ontologies like data models and description logics
\cite{Wong2012}.

In this work, the taxonomy of Wikidata is considered as case example, as it provides a high number of entities ($24507102$ in \dumpdate{}).
and a high degree of ''correctness'', since human editors constantly curate the existing knowledge.
In a complete taxonomy, a single root class exists, which is considered the most general concept \cite{Cimiano2006}. All other classes should therefore have a superclass.
Wikidata's taxonomy is incomplete in regards to this criteria. Superclass-less non-root classes are called orphan classes.
This work focuses on developing a hybrid algorithm for classification of orphan classes to reduce the incompleteness of taxonomies.
In Figure~\ref{fig:problem example}, a small section of Wikidata's taxonomy is shown. The orphan class \textit{reversal film} can be classified as a subclass of 
\textit{photographic film}.
The algorithm will use a neural network approach. This is motivated by the effectiveness of neural networks in other context-sensitive tasks
like language processing \cite{Mikolov2013} \cite{Kalchbrenner2014} \cite{Arisoy2012}, graph representation \cite{Cao2016}, image generation \cite{Gregor2015} etc.
Especially interesting are neural word embeddings \cite{Mikolov2013}, which have been used to great effect in the task of generating concept hierarchies by
\fullcite{Fu2014}. Different approaches in using neural word embeddings for classification of orphan classes will be considered and evaluated in this work.

The thesis is structured as follows.
In Section~\ref{section:foundations} the problem will be formally defined and related work in the fields of neural networks and ontology learning discussed for the use in this work.
Section~\ref{section:neural networks} introduces the notion of neural networks and discusses work dealing with neural word and graph embeddings.
Section~\ref{section:ontology learning} compares the problem, solved by the thesis, to related work in the field of ontology learning. 
The problem is classified and solutions to similar problems analyzed.
The novelty of the work is justified.
Section~\ref{section:taxonomy analysis} presents the Wikidata data set used as case example for the implementation and evaluation of the proposed hybrid algorithm. 
Section~\ref{section:algorithm} describes the components of the developed baseline algorithm and variations, which potentially improve the effectiveness of the method.
Section~\ref{section:evaluation} describes the evaluation methodology and presents the results.
The baseline algorithm and proposed improvements are evaluated.
