\textbf{TODO: Motivation. Related work. Solution. Evaluation.}

The thesis is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{section:foundations} defines the concepts related to Wikidata, taxonomies, similarity measures
and k-nearest-neighbors classification. Subsequently, the problem statement is formalized and its corresponding
challenges listed.
Section~\ref{section:taxonomy analysis} presents the results of the analysis of Wikidata's taxonomy.
Characteristics of unlinked classes are identified, and a specific subset of unlinked classes chosen,
which fulfills necessary requirements as input for an algorithm.
Section~\ref{section:ontology learning} compares the problem, solved by the thesis, to related work
in the field of ontology learning. The problem is classified and solutions to similar problems analyzed.
The novelty of the work is justified.\textbf{TODO: maybe reformulate the last sentence?}
Section~\ref{section:neural networks}.
Section~\ref{section:algorithm}.
Section~\ref{section:evaluation}.
Section~\ref{section:conclusion}.
