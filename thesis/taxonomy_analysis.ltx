For the task of developing an algorithm, which takes orphan classes as input, it is necessary to know,
what information the classes carry and if there are common characteristics among classes.

The taxonomy contained in the Wikidata dump of \dumpdate{} was analyzed.
It contains a total of $24,507,102$ items, of which $1,299,501$ are classes.
Classes were recognized as defined in Section~\ref{section:wikidata}. 

\subsection{Root taxonomy}
The state of the taxonomy was captured in regards to the root class \entity{} (see Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}).
$1,260,842$ classes are currently subclasses of \entity{}.
$97\%$ of all classes are  therefore nodes in the root taxonomy.
This implies a high agreement in the Wikidata community on which class is considered root,
and thereby also supports the modeling decision made in Section~\ref{section:taxonomy},
which assumes that a taxonomy only has one root, and this root is \entity{} in Wikidata.
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/taxonomy_analysis/distance_to_root.png}
\caption{Distance of subclasses to root class \entity{}. Wikidata (\dumpdate{})}
\label{fig:root distance}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}, the levels of the root taxonomy tree are represented. 
Most classes have a shortest distance between $6$ and $10$ to the root.
While the highest distance to the root is $20$. 
The most distant classes generally belong to concepts of biological taxonomies.
The most distant classes are subclasses of the genus \textit{Homo (Q171283)}.

The developed algorithm will likely place orphan classes into the same levels of the taxonomy, in which most classes already reside.
If the algorithm places classes in levels close to the root, it would indicate that the classification method is not specific enough.
On the opposite, placing classes into distant levels would indicate incorrectness of the algorithm, since only a small subset of classes occurs in these levels.

\subsection{All classes}

All $1,299,501$ classes were analyzed. $98.2\%$ of all classes have an English label.
In Figure~\ref{fig:all instance count}, the percentage of classes with a specific amount of instances is shown.
It can be seen that a majority of classes have no instances. 
The median of instances per class is $0$, while the average is $\approx 15$. 
The high average in comparison to the low median implies that there are some classes with a very high amount of instances.
Figure~\ref{fig:all subclass count} shows the percentage of classes with a specific amount of subclasses.
The median of subclasses per class $0$, while the average is $\approx 1.3$.
Most classes do not have subclasses or instances. 
Subsequently, this implies that almost all classes should have the \textit{subclass of (P279)},
since the other two criteria used to identify classes do not apply.
In Figure~\ref{fig:all property count}, the percentage of classes with a certain amount of properties is shown.
The median of properties is $7$, while the average is $\approx 6.65$.
The similar median and average implies that few outliers exist.
Figure~\ref{fig:all property frequency} supports this conclusion that the majority of classes have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property. 
Other very common properties like \textit{found in taxon (P703)}, \textit{Entrez Gene ID} and \textit{UniProt ID (P637)} indicate that at least $\approx 80\%$ of all classes
are related to genes and proteins.
The set of classes identified with these properties is mostly entered by bots, which map information from other knowledge bases like NCBI Entrez to Wikidata \cite{Putman2017}.
The characteristics of these classes is dissimilar to the human curated part of Wikidata, which is shown in the following Section~\ref{section:relevant classes}.
Additionally, the method developed by this thesis should find practical application by supporting humans in improving Wikidata's taxonomy.
Therefore, the set of classes related to proteins and genes is not of relevance to the problem, and should not be considered in the development of an solution.
Following, the set of relevant classes, which are of interest to human editors, is analyzed.

\subsection{Relevant classes}\label{section:relevant classes}
Following the observations in the previous section, the set of relevant classes was analyzed.
A class is considered relevant, if it does not have an irrelevant property.
The properties considered irrelevant identify classes representing genes and proteins.
The following properties are irrelevant:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Entrez Gene ID (P351)}
\item \textit{genomic start (P644)}
\item \textit{genomic end (P645)}
\item \textit{strand orientation (P2548)}
\item \textit{UniProt ID  (P352)}
\item \textit{NCBI Locus tag (P2393)}
\item \textit{encoded by (P702)}
\item \textit{encodes (P688)}
\item \textit{molecular function (P680)}
\item \textit{RefSeq RNA ID (P639)}
\item \textit{Mouse Genome Informatics ID  (P671)}
\item \textit{Ensembl Transcript ID (P704)}
\item \textit{HGNC gene symbol (P353)}
\item \textit{HomoloGene ID (P593)}
\item \textit{Gene Ontology ID (P686)}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
These properties were handpicked based on the property frequency in Figure~\ref{fig:all property frequency}.

A total of $224,873$ classes are relevant classes, which $\approx 17.3\%$ of all classes.
Of all relevant classes $89.5\%$ have an English label, which is almost $10\%$ percent less than the ratio of all classes.
The distribution of instances and subclasses is similar to the set of all classes (Figures~\ref{fig:relevant instance count} and~\ref{fig:relevant subclass count}).
The percentage of classes with $0$ instances is about $15\%$ lower and the percentage of classes with $0$ subclasses is $20\%$ lower.
Accordingly the instance average increases from $\approx 15$ to $\approx 86.34$, and the subclass average increases from $\approx 1.3$ to $\approx 6.5$.
The median remains unchanged at $0$ for both instances and subclasses.
Comparing the distribution of properties of all classes (Figure~\ref{fig:all property count}) to relevant classes (Figure~\ref{fig:relevant property count}) shows a shift to the left,
which implies a decrease of properties per class in the set of relevant classes.
The average decreased from $\approx 6.65$ to $4.49$ and the median decreased from $7$ to $3$.
Genes have simultaneously occurring properties, e.g. \textit{genomic end (P645)}, \textit{genomic start (P644)}, \textit{strand orientation (P2548)}, and \textit{Entrez Gene ID (P351)},
which results in a high percentage of classes having a similar number of properties, which is $7$ for the set of all classes.
Removing these classes consequently lowers the property median.
The property frequency (see Figure~\ref{fig:relevant property frequency}) shows a range of different properties,
which are not concerned with the same subject, as it was the case for the set of all classes.
The analysis does not show a bias to a certain topic for the set of relevant classes.
Therefore the developed algorithm will be developed and evaluated in regards to relevant classes rather than all classes.

\subsection{Orphan classes}
Orphan classes were identified by checking whether a class does not have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property.
The final goal of the thesis is to develop a method, which is able to classify orphan classes with a good accuracy.
However, orphan classes can not be used for testing the method, because a gold standard for orphan classes is missing.
Instead a gold standard can be extracted from the set of relevant classes.
To ensure that the gold standard evaluation is relevant to the given problem, the set of orphan classes has to be analyzed and compared to the set of relevant classes.
If the characteristics of both sets are similar, the gold standard evaluation is directly relevant to the performance in classifying orphan classes.

$16,373$ classes were identified as orphan classes, which is $\approx 1.26\%$ of all classes.
$\approx 84.33\%$ of all orphan classes have an English label, which is only $\approx 5\%$ lower than the relevant classes.
The distribution of instances for orphan classes (Figure~\ref{fig:orphan instance count} is very different to the relevant classes (Figure~\ref{fig:relevant class count}).
The majority of orphan classes have at least $1$ instance rather than $0$ instances.
Consequentially, the median of instances per class is $1$ for orphan classes and the average is $\approx 4.66$, which is much lower than the average $\approx 86.34$ of relevant classes.
This, in combination with the higher median for orphan classes, implies that orphan classes have none to very few outliers in regards to many instances.
Additionally, it can be hypothesized that orphan classes are often created for the purpose of classifying single instances by human editors, as a mean to provide a better description
for the instance, but the orphan class itself is not further described.
The subclass distribution (Figure~\ref{fig:orphan subclass count}) shows that $\approx 25\%$ of orphan classes have at least $1$ subclass, which is $\approx 20\%$ higher than
the relevant classes.
However, the median of subclasses per class remains $0$, while the average is $\approx 0.852$ and therefore lower than the average $6.5$ of relevant classes,
which indicates very low or not existing amount of outliers in the set of orphan classes. The same behavior was already observed for the instance distribution.
The distribution of properties per class (Figure~\ref{fig:orphan property count}) is very similar to the relevant classes (Figure~\ref{fig:relevant property count}).
The only difference is the percentage of classes with $0$ properties, which is $\approx 12.5\%$ for orphan classes and lower than $1\%$ for relevant classes.
This observation supports the previously made hypothesis, which claims that orphan classes are mainly created for the purpose of classifying instances,
since $12.5\%$ of orphan classes is not described at all. The corresponding property median remains at $3$ and the average is  $\approx 4.78$,
which is almost identical to the relevant classes.
The most frequent properties for orphan classes, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:orphan property frequency}, shows very similar properties to the relevant classes
(Figure~\ref{fig:relevant property frequency}). 
This, in addition to the similar property median, is a good indicator that orphan and relevant classes have common characteristics, since their descriptions are similar.
Therefore, it can be concluded that the set of relevant classes should be adequate at representing the set of orphan classes in the implementation and evaluation of the thesis' hybrid algorithm.
