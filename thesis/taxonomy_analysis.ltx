For the task of developing an algorithm, which takes unlinked classes as input, it is necessary to know,
what information the classes carry and if there are certain patterns among the classes.
For this purpose an analysis of the taxonomy needs to be carried out, which may answer questions.

The taxonomy contained in the Wikidata dump of \dumpdate{} was analyzed.
Classes were recognized as defined in Section~\ref{section:wikidata}. 
Unlinked classes were identified by checking whether a class does not have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property.
The taxonomy contained a total of $1299501$ classes at this time.

\subsection{Root taxonomy}
The state of the taxonomy was captured in regards to the root class \entity{} (see Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}).
$1260842$ classes are currently subclasses of \entity{}.
$97\%$ of all classes are  therefore nodes in the root taxonomy.
This implies a high agreement in the Wikidata community on which class is considered root,
and thereby also supports the modeling decision made in Section~\ref{section:taxonomy},
which assumes that a taxonomy only has one root, and this root is \entity{} in Wikidata.

\label{fig:root distance}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Last sentences of this paragraph are mostly interesting trivia, but have currently no further use.}
The longest shortest distance between the root and a leaf class is $20$. 
The classes \textit{Q639064}, \textit{Q15978631} and \textit{Q151055} fulfill this characteristics. 
Each of them is subclass of \textit{Homo (Q171283)}. 

\subsection{Unlinked classes}
The characteristics of all unlinked classes and the root class were analyzed.
This set contains a total of $16373$ classes. $13807$ classes have an English label
and $11534$ classes have a corresponding English Wikipedia page.

Regarding the  number of unique properties (or statement groups) per class 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked property count}) the median is $3$ and the average is $\approx 4.8$.
Combined with the analyzed unique property frequency (see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked property frequency}),
it can be seen that many unlinked classes are linked to other knowledge bases and taxonomies
, e.g. Freebase or GND, using an identifier.
 Another  observation is that $901$ of the unlinked classes have properties related to taxons,
 which is a, to some degree, separate taxonomy in Wikidata, created with properties like
 \textit{taxon name (P225)}, \textit{parent taxon (P171)}, etc.
 
Most unlinked classes have only $0$ to $1$ instances, the median is $1$ and the average
is $\approx 4.65$ instances per class (see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked instance count}).
There are however outliers with big numbers of instances, which skew the average number of instances per class.
This may for example imply, that classes are created mainly for the purpose of grouping newly created
instances.

The median and average for subclasses per class are $0$ and $\approx 0.85$ respectively 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked subclass count}). This implies that the graph components of
the unlinked classes are very small, and in most cases contain only the respective unlinked class.

The question has to be asked,  whether an algorithm should try to handle the complete set of
unlinked classes, or only a specific subset, which fulfills certain requirements.
The answer depends on what information such an algorithm requires as input.
The full set of unlinked classes is problematic for use in an algorithm as there are few shared characteristics
over all classes.
$\approx 16\%$ of classes are not labeled and $\approx 31.4\%$ of classes have no instances.
Both labels and instances are useful characteristics for a class to have.
The label allows the recognition of the class in natural text and ensures that the class fulfills a basic quality criteria,
since the label is the first characteristic of a Wikidata item, which should be created by a user \cite{WikidataNewItem}.
Instances represent classes and thereby describe them. For example, \fullcite{Rodriguez2003} use
instances  to compute semantic similarity between classes.
Therefore, I propose to only consider the set of classes, which have a label in the English language 
and at least $1$ instance, as input for the algorithm.

\subsection{Labeled, instantiated, unlinked classes}
Following this argument, the subset of labeled, instantiated and unlinked classes was analyzed.
This set contains a total of $9157$ classes. $7557$ classes have an English Wikipedia page, which is 
$\approx 82.5\%$ of all analyzed classes in the subset, and an increase of $\approx 12\%$ in comparison 
to the full set of unlinked classes.

The average of unique properties per class increases from $4.8$ to $5.5$, while the median remains at $3$
(see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked labeled instantiated property count}).
The frequency of different properties appearing in classes however is more distributed 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked labeled instantiated property frequency}).
This implies that the classes of this subset are related to different topics, and share only few commonalities.

As expected the average of instances per class increased to $\approx 7.37$ from $\approx 4.65$.
However the median is still $1$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked labeled instantiated instance count}).
$\approx 59\%$ of classes have only $1$ instance.

At the same time the average of subclasses per class halved to $\approx 0.4$ 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:unlinked labeled instantiated subclass count}). 
Combined with the 
unchanged median of $1$ instance per class, supports the assumption, that classes are mainly
created for the purpose of grouping instances,
while adding the newly created class to the main taxonomy is being neglected.

\end{figure}

The classes of the subset have, on average, a better level of description, more unique properties and instances,
than the full set of unlinked classes. Between these classes the number of commonalities
is lower, because the same properties occur not as frequently for different classes.
The lack of commonalties between unlinked classes is not very problematic, as the algorithm
would not compare unlinked classes with each other but with classes in the root taxonomy.

\subsection{Discussion (TODO: new subsection title)}
After completing the analysis, it can be seen that \entity{} is the root class of the taxonomy,
and Wikidata's taxonomy is in a good state, since $97\%$ of classes are part of the root taxonomy.
\textbf{TODO: not sure if i can just say that it is in a good state}
Unlinked classes share few commonalities, and as shown above, a percentage of classes lack even
basic information like a label. 
For developing an algorithm it is necessary to set a baseline, of what can be expected from the input.
In this case, input is required to be labeled and have at least one instance.
The benefit of this specific restriction is, that a basic level of descriptiveness can be assumed for
every class. A label additionally allows supplementing the information, provided by Wikidata, to
be supplemented with natural text sources, like Wikipedia, since it is now possible to recognize
occurrences of the class in text.
