For the task of developing an algorithm, which takes orphan classes as input, it is necessary to know,
what information the classes carry and if there are certain patterns among the classes.
For this purpose an analysis of the taxonomy needs to be carried out, which may answer questions.

The taxonomy contained in the Wikidata dump of \dumpdate{} was analyzed.
It contains a total of $24507102$ items, of which $1299501$ are classes.
Classes were recognized as defined in Section~\ref{section:wikidata}. 

\subsection{Root taxonomy}
The state of the taxonomy was captured in regards to the root class \entity{} (see Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}).
$1260842$ classes are currently subclasses of \entity{}.
$97\%$ of all classes are  therefore nodes in the root taxonomy.
This implies a high agreement in the Wikidata community on which class is considered root,
and thereby also supports the modeling decision made in Section~\ref{section:taxonomy},
which assumes that a taxonomy only has one root, and this root is \entity{} in Wikidata.

\label{fig:root distance}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}, the levels of the root taxonomy tree are represented. 
Most classes have a shortest distance between $6$ and $10$ to the root.
While the highest distance to the root is $20$. 
The most distant classes generally belong to concepts of biological taxonomies.
The most distant classes are subclasses of the genus \textit{Homo (Q171283)}.

The developed algorithm will likely place orphan classes into the same levels of the taxonomy, in which most classes already reside.
If the algorithm places classes in levels close to the root, it would indicate that the classification method is not specific enough but not necessarily.
On the opposite, placing classes into distant levels would indicate incorrectness of the algorithm, since only a very specific subset of classes occur there.

\subsection{Orphan classes}
Orphan classes were identified by checking whether a class does not have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property.
