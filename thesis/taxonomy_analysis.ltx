For the task of developing an algorithm, which takes orphan classes as input, it is necessary to know,
what information the classes carry and if there are common characteristics among classes.

The taxonomy contained in the Wikidata dump of \dumpdate{} was analyzed.
It contains a total of $24,507,102$ items, of which $1,299,501$ are classes.
Classes were recognized as defined in Section~\ref{section:wikidata}. 

\subsection{Root taxonomy}
The state of the taxonomy was captured in regards to the root class \entity{} (see Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}).
$1,260,842$ classes are currently subclasses of \entity{}.
$97\%$ of all classes are  therefore nodes in the root taxonomy.
This implies a high agreement in the Wikidata community on which class is considered root,
and thereby also supports the modeling decision made in Section~\ref{section:taxonomy},
which assumes that a taxonomy only has one root, and this root is \entity{} in Wikidata.

\label{fig:root distance}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:root distance}, the levels of the root taxonomy tree are represented. 
Most classes have a shortest distance between $6$ and $10$ to the root.
While the highest distance to the root is $20$. 
The most distant classes generally belong to concepts of biological taxonomies.
The most distant classes are subclasses of the genus \textit{Homo (Q171283)}.

The developed algorithm will likely place orphan classes into the same levels of the taxonomy, in which most classes already reside.
If the algorithm places classes in levels close to the root, it would indicate that the classification method is not specific enough.
On the opposite, placing classes into distant levels would indicate incorrectness of the algorithm, since only a small subset of classes occurs in these levels.

\subsection{All classes}

All $1,299,501$ classes were analyzed. $98.2\%$ of all classes are labeled.
In Figure~\ref{fig:all instance count}, the percentage of classes with a specific amount of instances is shown.
It can be seen that a majority of classes have no instances. 
The median of instances per class is $0$, while the average is $\approx 15$. 
The high average in comparison to the low median implies that there are some classes with a very high amount of instances.
Figure~\ref{fig:all subclass count} shows the percentage of classes with a specific amount of subclasses.
The median of subclasses per class $0$, while the average is $\approx 1.3\%$.
Most classes do not have subclasses or instances. 
Subsequently, this implies that almost all classes should have the \textit{subclass of (P279)},
since the other two criteria used to identify classes do not apply.
In Figure~\ref{fig:all property count}, the percentage of classes with a certain amount of properties is shown.
The median of properties is $7$, while the average is $\approx 6.65\%$.
The similar median and average implies that few outliers exist.
Figure~\ref{fig:all property frequency} supports this conclusion that the majority of classes have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property. 
Other very common properties like \textit{found in taxon (P703)}, \textit{Entrez Gene ID} and \textit{UniProt ID (P637)} indicate that at least $\approx 80\%$ of all classes
are related to genes and proteins.
The set of classes identified with these properties is mostly entered by bots, which map information from other knowledge bases like NCBI Entrez to Wikidata \cite{Putman2017}.
The characteristics of these classes is dissimilar to the human curated part of Wikidata, which is shown in the following Section~\ref{section:relevant classes}.
Additionally, the method developed by this thesis should find practical application by supporting humans in improving Wikidata's taxonomy.
Therefore, the set of classes related to proteins and genes is not of relevance to the problem, and should not be considered in the development of an solution.
Following, the set of relevant classes, which are of interest to human editors, is analyzed.

\subsection{Orphan classes}
Orphan classes were identified by checking whether a class does not have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property.
