For the task of developing an algorithm, which takes unlinked classes as input, it is necessary to know,
what information the classes carry and if there are certain patterns among the classes.
For this purpose an analysis of the taxonomy needs to be carried out, which may answer questions.
Additionally other knowledge can be gained through this knowledge.

The taxonomy contained in the Wikidata dump of \dumpdate was analyzed.
Classes were recognized as defined in Section~\ref{section:wikidata}. 
Unlinked classes were identified by checking whether a class does not have the \textit{subclass of (P279)} property.
The taxonomy contained a total of $1299501$ classes at this time.

First, the state of the taxonomy was captured in regards to the root class \entity{}.
$1260842$ classes are currently subclasses of \entity{}.
$97\%$ of all classes are  therefore nodes in the same graph component as the root class.
This implies a high agreement in the Wikidata community on which class is considered root,
and thereby also supports the modeling decision made in Section~\ref{section:taxonomy},
which assumes that a taxonomy only has one root, and this root is \entity{} in Wikidata.

Second, the characteristics of all unlinked classes and the root class were analyzed.
This set contains a total of $16373$ classes.

Following this argument, the subset of labeled, instantiated and unlinked classes was analyzed.
This set contains a total of $5776$ classes.
