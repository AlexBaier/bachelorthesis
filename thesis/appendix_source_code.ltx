Source code is available under \url{https://github.com/AlexBaier/bachelorthesis}.

Code is written in Python3. Used third party libraries are listed in \textit{requirements.txt}.
Each module refers to a specific chapter, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Taxonomy analysis (see Chapter~\ref{section:taxonomy analysis}) is implemented in \textit{data\_analysis}.
\item Algorithm components (see Chapter~\ref{section:algorithm}) is implemented in \textit{algorithm}.
\item Execution and evaluation of algorithms (see Chapter~\ref{section:evaluation}) is implemented in \textit{evaluation}.
\item Scripts, which are used to execute the above functionality is placed in \textit{scripts}.
\end{itemize}
Input and output of scripts is configured in \textit{paths\_config.json}.
Hyperparameters and combinations of hybrid algorithms are configured in in \textit{algorithm\_config.json}.

The list of irrelevant properties as defined in Section~\ref{section:relevant classes}
is stored under \textit{irrelevant\_properties.txt}.
