	abstract = {Recent trends suggest that neural-network-inspired word embedding models outperform traditional count-based distributional models on word similarity and analogy detection tasks. We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

% hierarchy learning via word embeddings
@article{Fu2014,
abstract = {Semantic hierarchy construction aims to build structures of concepts linked by hypernym–hyponym (“is-a”) relations. A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations. This paper proposes a novel and effec- tive method for the construction of se- mantic hierarchies based on word em- beddings, which can be used to mea- sure the semantic relationship between words. We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym–hyponym rela- tion by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms. Our result, an F-score of 73.74{\%}, outperforms the state-of-the- art methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve F- score to 80.29{\%}. 1},
