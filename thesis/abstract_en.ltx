Knowledge bases, such as DBpedia, YAGO, and Wikidata, store information about all significant entities and their relationships.
An ontology defines data schemas, vocabularies, hierarchies, and rules about the validity and derivability of information.
This enable the modeling, sharing and exchange of information.
The taxonomy, also called concept or class hierarchy, is a fundamental component of an ontology.
In a taxonomy, classes are arranged hierarchically linked by a subclass-of relation.
Complete taxonomies have exactly one most common class the root class, which is called \textit{entity} in Wikidata.
This root class is unique, as it is the only class, which has no superclasses in the taxonomy.
However, Wikidata's taxonomy is incomplete in regard to this property.
Orphan classes violate the uniqueness of the root class by also possessing no superclasses.

The aim of the thesis is the development and evaluation of a method for the classification of orphan classes in the Wikidata taxonomy.
The classification problem poses a particular challenge to the developed solution, since theoretically every other class in the taxonomy represents a possible superclass for a given orphan class.
In Wikidata, the classification problem therefore has over $100,000$ possible superclasses.

The Wikidata taxonomy has a high degree of completeness with regard to the orphan class problem, as only ${\sim} 0.3\%$ of classes are not subclasses of the root class.
Due the automated addition of classes from foreign sources, such as protein and gene databases, only ${\sim} 15\%$ of the taxonomy are relevant to human users.
Therefore, the development and evaluation of the algorithms focuses only on this relevant subset.

The developed hybrid algorithms use word embeddings to represent entities of the knowledge base.
Word embeddings encode the semantic and lexicographical properties of words in text as vectors.
This allows the application of widely used vector-based methods such as regression and neural networks.
The representation of Wikidata statements in triples enables the application of Word2Vec, which maps Wikidata entities to embeddings.
The classification of orphan classes can then be performed using embeddings.
Nearest-neighbors classification, linear projection, and non-linear regression via neural networks were implemented as classifiers.
With an accuracy of $22.83\%$, nearest-neighbor classification is the best performing hybrid algorithm.
